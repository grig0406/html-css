    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p><span class="Tags">Hypertext Markup Language (<span class="term">HTML</span>)</span> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
    </p>

        <p>Web browsers receive <span class="term">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
        into multimedia web pages.<br> <span class="term">HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
        included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
        
        <p><span class="term">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span class="term">HTML</span> pages. With <span class="term">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects 
        such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <span class="term">HTML</span> provides a means to create 
        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, 
        quotes and other items. <span class="term">HTML</span> elements are delineated by <i>tags</i>, written using angle brackets. Tags such as 
        <span class="cod">&lt;img/&gt;</span> and <span class="cod">&lt;input /&gt;</span> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span class="cod">&lt;p&gt;</span> surround and 
        provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not 
        display the <span class="term">HTML</span> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        </p>

        <h2>Markup</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="term">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called <i>tags</i> (<i>and their attributes</i>), character-based <i>data types, character references</i> and <i>entity references.</i> 
            <span class="term">HTML</span> tags most commonly come in pairs like <span class="cod">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and <span class="cod">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>, although some represent <i>empty elements</i> and so are unpaired, for example <span class="cod">&lt;ing&gt;</span>. 
            The first tag in such a pair is the start <i>tag</i>, and the second is the <i>end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags</i>).
            </p>

            <p>Another important component is the <span class="term">HTML</span> <i>document type declaration</i>, which triggers standards mode rendering.
                </p>

            <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
        </p>
        <div>

            <pre class="code2">

    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;<span class="text">This is a title</span>&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;<span class="text">Hello world!</span>&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;

            </pre>
        </div>

        <div>
